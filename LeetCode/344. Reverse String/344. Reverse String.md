# 344. Reverse String

## Description

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `char[]`.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array** [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of [printable ascii characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

```C
void reverseString(char* s, int sSize) {
    int head = 0;
    // The last element of string is '\0'.
    int tail = sSize - 1;
    while (head < tail) {
        // Swapping two characters.
        int temp = s[head];
        s[head] = s[tail];
        s[tail] = temp;
        head++;
        tail--;
    }
}
```
