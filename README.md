TODO: need to finish README.md

TODO: rename this Repo.

UPDATE: refer to the notes plan on Montblanc.

## Main propose

- A repo contains Learning notes of computer science & Mathematics.
- Algorithms (LeetCode...) into this Repo? or a separate one.

> I believe put these Learning resources together would be better.
>
> LeetCode: -> markdown + codes (+ diagrams).

- Some little programs (do I need a separate repo?)
- Timeline or plan for the Term break (before 23:59, Sunday 23 August).
- CSS, H5, LaTeX and markdown for notes taking.

- !!! SSH and GitHub Learning. (Should I put these "TODO" into my plan?)

- Choose a license.

- Planning on Saturday! (Today)
