TODO: need to finish README.md

## Main propose

- A repo contains Learning notes of computer science & Mathematics.
- Some little programs (do I need a separate repo?)
- Timeline or plan for the Term break (before 23:59, 21 August).
- CSS, H5, LaTeX and markdown for notes taking.

- !!! SSH and GitHub Learning. (Should I put these "TODO" into my plan?)
