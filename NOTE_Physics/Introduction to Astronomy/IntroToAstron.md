### 1.1 Introduction to Astronomy

> The components of the universe (stars, planets and galaxies), the scale of the universe, a brief historical guide to the study of astronomy.

**Astronomy** is the scientific study of celestial objects — e.g. Planets, Stars, Galaxies, and the Universe as a whole.

**Tools:** Telescopes, Spacecraft, Computers, The Internet and Laboratories……

**Other "Astro" Words**: Astrology<sup>(Not Science)</sup>, Astrophysics, Astrobiology, Astrometry and Astronautics.

|-------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Before 3000 BC    | Mesopotamia / Sumerians       | developed **the first form of writing** (cuneiform);                           |
|                   |                               | studied the motions of celestial bodies;                                       |
|                   |                               | developed the sexagesimal (base 60) system of numbers (time and angles).       |
| ca 4000 - 2000 BC | Southern England / Stonehenge | left structures with astronomical alignments with the rising and setting Sun on specific dates; |
|                   |                               | possibly involved in the keeping of time;                                      |
|                   |                               | or they may have served a more religious and/or ceremonial role.               |
| ca 580 - 500 BC   | Ancient Greece / Pythagoras   | developed **the geocentric model** that Earth is centre of Universal.          |
| ca 427 - 347 BC   | Plato and his pupil, Eudoxus  | In his model the Earth was at the centre and there were a series of concentric spheres carrying the Sun, Moon and planets, and an outer sphere carrying the fixed stars. |
|                   | The Greek philosophers        | developed increasingly complex systems of spheres carried on other spheres, or circles carried on larger circles, because it was clear that planetary motion could not be modelled  with a single circular motion about the Earth. |
| ca 100 - 170 AD   | **Claudius Ptolemy**          | wrote a treatise on astronomy known as *the Almagest* to explain the planetary motions reached its culmination, and it is the only comprehensive work on ancient astronomy to be preserved to the present day; |
|                   |                               | was best available geocentric model for the planetary motions.                 |
|                   |                               | **The Ptolemaic System [1]**                                                   |
| 1543 AD           | **Nicolaus Copernicus**       | published his book *De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium* (On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres), |
|                   |                               | proposed a model of the Solar system with the Sun, rather than the Earth, at the centre. But Copernicus still used the platonic idea of circular motions and so he still needed systems of multiple circles to explain the actual motions of the planets (which move on elliptical, rather than circular orbits). |
|                   |                               | **The Copernican (or Heliocentric) System [2]**                                |
| 1546 - 1601 AD    | Tyco Brahe                    | provided the result of astronomical observations which Kepler used as below.   |
| 1571 - 1630 AD    | **Johannes Kepler**           | provided the **final solution** to the problem of planetary motions;           |
|                   |                               | determined that the orbits of the planets were ellipses, not circles.          |
|                   |                               | **Kepler's Laws [3]**                                                          |
|                   | Hans Lippershey               | invented the telescope.                                                        |
| 1609 AD           | **Galileo Galilei**           | made his own telescope and observed the moons of Jupiter. The observations he made with it provided strong evidence in favour of the Copernican, Sun-centered, heliocentric model of the universe; |
|                   |                               | discovered the phase of Venus.                                                 |
|                   |                               | **The Phases of Venus [4]**                                                    |
| 1642 - 1726 AD    | **Isaac Newton**              | published his book *the Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica* in 1687; |
|                   |                               | found **a universal force of gravitation** that acts between any two objects in the universe and depends on their mass. |
|                   |                               | **The Universal Force of Gravitation [5]**                                     |
| 1838 AD           | Friedrich Bessel              | was first successful measured the stellar parallax of **the star 61 Cygni**, and obtained a distance of **9.8 light years**. |
| Rapidly Followed  |                               | **Alpha Centauri** was found to be the closest star system to our own Sun at a distance of about **4.3 light years**. |

Not only was the Earth no longer at the centre of the universe, but even the Sun itself was just one of billions of stars making up our Milky Way galaxy. In fact it is now thought there are several hundred billions of stars in the Milky Way. With modern telescopes we can see galaxies out to distances of billions of light years, which means there are many billions of galaxies within our universe.

**Astronomical Unit (AU):** The distance between the Sun and the Earth about $150,000,000$ km ($1.5 \times 10^{11}$ m).

**Light Speed:** $3 \times 10^{8}$ m/s.

**Light Year:** The **distance** that light travels in one year, about $9,460,700,000,000$ km ($63,241$ AUs).

**Scale of the Solar System:** It takes light about 8 minutes 20 seconds to get from the Sun to the Earth, and 4 hours to get from the Earth out to the orbit of Neptune.
    <img src="./img/1-1-7.png" alt="The Solar System" width="640">

**Scale of the Milky Way Galaxy:** The Sun is about  25,000 light years from the centre of the galaxy. The Milky Way galaxy is a disk about 100,000 light years across, and it contains about 200 billion stars.

**Scale of Galaxies and Clusters:** There are dwarf galaxies containing only 100 million stars, and giant galaxies containing as many as 1 trillion stars.
  - *Elliptical Galaxies*, which are just an elliptically shaped cloud of stars.
  - *Spiral Galaxies* (our Milky Way galaxy is one), and these have a pattern of spiral arms. The spiral arms are the regions where new stars are forming.
  - *Barred Spirals* where the spiral arms appear to originate from a bar spanning across the centre.
  - *Irregular Galaxies* that have no particular shape. The **Large Magellanic Cloud** in one of these.
  - *Clusters of Galaxies* where galaxies are clumped together in groups nonrandomly.
  - *Super Clusters* where the clusters of galaxies are grouped together.

Our own Milky Way galaxy is part of a small group of galaxies called the Local Group, and this is part of a much larger group of galaxies called the local super cluster.

**Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT)** used an instrument called the **Two-degree Field (2dF)**. 2dF was able to measure the spectra of 400 galaxies at one time. From the spectrum it is possible to determine the distance to each galaxy, and so plot these galaxies on a 3D map.

**Hubble Space Telescope:** More distant galaxies can be seen in deep exposures with it.

So in the 2000 years or so since the time of the ancient Greeks, we have gone from a universe that had the Earth at its centre, to a universe in which the Earth is just one planet orbiting a fairly ordinary star, which itself is just one of the hundreds of billions of stars in our galaxy, with our galaxy being just one of hundreds of billions within the universe as a whole.
